# Hungry (Restaurant-App)
A materialistic and adaptive restaurant reccomender mobile application, created in Flutter and Dart. Hungry takes several aspects of user information, including price range, traveling distance, and cuisine type into account before ranking nearby reccomendations. 


Made by Christopher Gong and Ankush Vangari.

## Algorithm
Hungry's algorithm works by mapping users to a point in n dimentional space, where n is the search criterion. It then maps the nearby restaurants on the same scale, and returns the restaurant with the closest euclidian restaurant to the user as the highest reccomendation.
